This repo contains modular code that can be implemented into any sdl2 projects.

With useful common functions such as:

init()
 - A simple function that intializes a renderer and a window and returns an error otherwise.

main()
 - contains a loop for gameplay logic

PlayerClass()
- Simple logic for a rectangular player including collision detection and collision resolution

movement()
- generic platformer movement

jump()
- I like to reuse this implementation specifically because the jump feels nice to use
- variable jump height depending on length of button press
